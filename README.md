# CFA

Cross-File Associations (CFAs) are a way to declare relationships among files and file-like objects. They help software and humans to be smarter about grouping things together. Their theory is explained in an [academic paper](https://dhh1128.github.io/papers/cfa_paper.html)

CFAs aren't for expressing every nuance of relationships; rather, they make it easy to say the basics. They're simple enough for anybody to use without special tools, but sophisticated enough to enable powerful features in software that wants to be helpful.
