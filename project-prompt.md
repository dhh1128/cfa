I have written a developer's guide for a new technique of associating files with one another using sidecar and similar strategies. I call this technique "Cross-File Associations" or CFA. The developer guide is embodied in a set of *.md files in the project, beginning with README.md.

The developer's guide explains some of the theory behind this technique. However, it is not a good explanation of the philosophical, logical, and computer science considerations behind the design, and it is not citable in other academic writings or standards that might need to benefit from it. I would therefore like to write a rigorous academic paper that explains the idea and justifies its need and its unique contribution vis-a-vis other ideas. Once the paper is written, I intend to submit it to an academic journal, and also to publish it on ssrn.com.

The project is to work with you to develop this rigorous academic paper.
